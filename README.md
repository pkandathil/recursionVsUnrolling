The purpose of this example is to provide a simple guide to showing a user how to solve a problem with recursion and loop unrolling and to have a conversation about the pros and cons of each technique.

We are going to use the Fibonacci sequence as a problem where we can apply recursion or loop unrolling to reach a solution.

```
For all n >= 0

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
```
